ROBOCOMMANDER v1.0 INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

Author: Terry Tam

1. In x-term #1, compile the robot code by going to the robot directory, then type:
     make
     ./ins
2. Go to robot/cfg and view the wlanconf.txt file, and remember the
   last octet of the listed IP address (i.e. the D part, in the address A.B.C.D)
3. Go to base/work and type:
     make
4. Go to base/work/client and type:
     ./conf
   When asked to enter the "robot id", enter the number obtained in step #2. For the
   other prompts, just press enter to set the listed default values. (Alternatively
	 you can edit the 'conf.cfg' file)
5. In x-term #2, go to base/work/RoboCommander and type:
     java RoboWirelessBase
   Wait until no more messages are displayed
6. In x-term #1, type:
     ./client
7. In the RoboCommander popup, send the (name,value) commands: 
     (mode,0) - used to initialise the robot
     (c,1)    - used to stop the robot
8. For a list of send commands, see 'robot/commtrunk/DotsAndSpots.txt'
9. The dog can controlled manually via the keyboard, by clicking the 'Motion'
   button once, and then using the following keys: 
     - W = move forwards
     - S = move backwards
     - A = strafe left
     - D = strafe right
     - Q = turn left
     - E = turn right
     - I = move head up
		 - K = move head down
		 - J = move head left
		 - L = move head right
10. These buttons use sticky keys, so when a button is pressed, the dog will
   continue to move without the button needing to be held down. In order to 
   stop movement, you need to press the key of the opposite direction. To
	 stop all dog movement, send the command pair (c, 1)
