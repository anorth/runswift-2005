"udpcheck" is a simple program which monitors the dogs' frequent UDP
world model transmissions.

USAGE
=============================
Usage: udpcheck last-ip-bit [last-ip-bits ...]

EXAMPLES
=============================
To monitor transmissions of a dog with the ip address 192.168.0.137, type:

udpcheck 137

Note: The port used by a dog with the ip address 192.168.0.137 is shared by all
dogs within 192.168.0.130 to 192.168.0.139. So this command would actually
monitor all dogs in the 192.168.0.13x range. "udpcheck 130" would have the same
effect, too.

To monitor transmissions of all dogs from 192.168.0.100 to
192.168.0.200 (technically to 192.168.0.209), type:

udpcheck 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200

EXTRA (some explanations)
=============================
At the moment, the dogs broadcast the world model to a port which is dependant
on the dog's current IP address.

Currently, the formula for the port is:
(last part of ip address / 10) * 3 + 11900

So if the dog's address is 192.168.0.165, this is calculated as follows:

= (165 / 10) * 3 + 11900
= 16 * 3 + 11900
= 48 + 11900
= 11948

According to this formula, all dogs which occupy the same "tens" range (e.g.
160-169) will share the same port for UDP transmissions.

Byte endianness has not been considered in this program, so it'll only work on
x86 for the time being.

COMPILING
=============================
Use the makefile. "make" should do it.

udpcheck requires ncurses to compile.  For debian, this package would be 
"libncurses-dev", so apt-get install that if it can't find ncurses.h or 
something.
