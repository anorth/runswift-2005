import Player


#===============================================================================
# These following statments are sort of like main function in C.
#===============================================================================

# Usually only the top-level module have these, but this module (not the top-level
# module) is an exception because only Behaviou.py is importing this, and we 
# want to use this module to really reload codes once imported.


# The reload(module) function is a python built-in function. When called, the 
# module.py will be read, interpreted, and top-level statements executed if there 
# is any.
reload(Player)


# That's it , nothing's complicated , huh?
