To compile,
  % make           [fix any errors]
  % ./spip <player> <ip>
Where <player> is "pForward", "pGoalie" or any other Python module implementing
DecideNextAction(). <ip> is an ip suffix, e.g. "142". Last digit is used as
player number (e.g. 2). Second last digit is used as team (e.g. 4).

  [insert memory stick]
  % ./os           [copies system to stick]
  % ./ins          [copies files to memory stick]
  [remove memory stick, boot AIBO, enjoy]

* NOTES (all handled by ./ins) *

Any of the images will work fine with the binary generated here

`nomemprot' is explicitly requested by the binary

The images referred to are in: /usr/local/OPEN_R_SDK/OPEN_R/MS/
We are using WCONSOLE/nomemprot at the moment.

Configuration files

Under ./cfg find the following and copy them onto the stick at the specified
locations or perform `make prep',
