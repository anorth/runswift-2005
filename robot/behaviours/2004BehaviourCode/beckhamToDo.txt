------- START HIGHER PRIORITY LIST

check variance before considering opponents... (am i making the variance too small??)

if theres only 2 forwards alive they will both attack rather than have one striker
i think if your very close to the goal mouth, you should have 1 stiker??? rather than 2 attackers??
average of support pos and the striker pos?

do not follow wireless ball along the path between the ball and the goal
do repulsion field thing
if you cant see the ball (and someone else can??) and your in the way get out of the way
make get behind ball circle bigger
pick the get behind ball direction that avoids hitting the other dog
in side backoff case, one of the dogs go slower... hopefully he will then drop into backoff

somewhat in order of benifit to performacne......

prevAttackMode != GetBehindBall
does this statement actually work in our strategy? cause its used all over the
place

grab ball trigger and track ball
fumbling makes the dogs MISS SOOOO MANY OPPORTUNITIES !!!!!!!! see misc section for some thoughts about this

back off symmetry BACK OFF SYMMETERY BREAKING IS BAD !!
backoff breaking not only consider heading to dkd... but also whether the other guy can see the ball.. heading to ball etc

theres 2 strikers at a time ??? yes they are very decisive and it goes on for fairly long periods of time

1. visual goal not effective when your near an edge because you cant turn, and you try to turn for 3 seconds 
2. in one game i see the grab trigger do several FAKE TRIGGERS especially in a SCRUMS which causes it to go into vis goal routine which takes ages


backoff in find ball shouldn't stop the spin component... might as well implement force field

we need to make the forwards help the goalie more
ie so the goalie is the second level of defence only

goalie still needs to stay in the box more... im seeing goals get scored when goalie comes out and yeah dots gets it around the goalie and scores....
but this means the forwards need to change too

defense striker.. when ball gets close attack even if your not third closests? and rely on back off to keep you spread??

GOALIE DONT TURN BALL TOWARDS YOUR OWN GOAL
EG YOU CAN SEE IT YOU TURN AND FLICK IT
MAYBE YOU NEED A SMART ARSE KICK
ive tried to keep the goalie in the goal box to try and prevent this from happening

------- END HIGHER PRIORITY LIST

ask ricky to make avaliable which ball distance method is being used,.. ie blob area, andres method and fireball

avoid walking into the back of other robots... teammates and opponents??
without compromising ball attack

turn kick needs calibration again
seems to over turn kick

goalie hold ball needs to time out

dont paw kick in the corner away from the goal!!! -- done took away one of the paw kick conditions
set up the chest push for the striker instead???
if no opponents???

when opponents are near, sometimes its better to charge rather than paw kick it
because on collision with the opponent they would get the better of the ball if they are aligning with chest and your aligning with paw

smart wireless ball when your in the region

getting behind ball over 90  -- caused by odometry problems

does the forward vector in the turn kick effect its reliability on the walls?

try to get rid of locks from do support

in the backoff sym break stuff
check out the backoff lock stuff

hysterisis about which 3rd point to choose when ball near half way line

is think there is a problem with visual goal on the right hand side of the field??

striker defence.. can he be more useful?? he just waits there for the ball to come that way
seems to be effective though

dont get close to striker??? if striker is there leave him?????????

if you cant see the ball make the back off strat do something diff? 

in the determine striker function
should we be looking at teammates variance??

with all the striker defense striker offense support positions
reconsider this crossing the line thing.. it doesnt' really matter if your clearly
behind the point and your not going to cross the line

in isBeckhamHaveBall
i dont really know if i like util is up
60 buffer zone is very large.. and it should be forced to your heading to the goal??
abit scared that the dkd is too risky

in isBeckhamStuck
what if on those other 60 frames 
you werent actually walking forward

remind eric to fix the find ball hack from maverick

grabinterval
put in the chestpush after the turn kick thing

in the am to assume striker function
take into account if another dog has died or has been taken off the field
because when one dog died, the second closest becomes the striker

3rd player was attacking .. does it quite alot

it was backing off instead of turning around even though the wireless ball was behind it

find ball spreading out (and also the thing where if 2 are spining the 3rd shouldnt bother)

if teammate in face walk backwards

//   ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND ARE NOT TESTED ENOUGH
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

goalie wont START to attack ball in corner if theres an opponent closer to the ball
although once it starts it will keep going

//CHECK BEHAVIOUR OF THIS IN A GAME
strikers and supporters after doing active localise look back to where the ball was

if you are striker and ball in strike position dont be 3rd
ie have the case where you actually STRIKE the ball!!

DONT FIND BALL ANYWHERE NEAR GOAL MOUTH CAUSE ITS JUST IN THE WAY!!

support position and 3rd player position might be at the same place 

play with striker position
maybe go back to the relative scheme ???
not really a priority??

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//   ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND ARE SATISFACTORY
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

turn kick 180s fixed so it doesn't do those 270's anymore..

support behaviour near side edges changed so support will get behind and hug the wall.

fixed the no strikers near target goal problem.. also if only 2 dogs, if your near target goal
one will more likely be striker rather than support

turn kicking the ball away from own goal when you can

backoff attack region is either towards target goal or away from own goal

i dont know about the beacons that it choses to look at when it does active localise.. its ok could be better i spose

edge and wall behaviour needs working ie turning into edges and stuff!!! --probably addressed by turning lines back on =) whoops

find ball is too slow ie the first part..
also should stand and find ball for a little while before starting to turn

the support turning into back defender thing when your near the target goal

dobeckham backoff forward
using visball without checking you can see

theres 2 dogs that think it is the 3rd at any one time

include shooting at vis goal

check the m==0 divide by zero cases in the support roles

make the striker and support
head find ball
and active localise

when you have approximately reached the strike point dont move until you have left the strike point by alot

grab ball trigger and track ball
fumbling makes the dogs MISS SOOOO MANY OPPORTUNITIES !!!!!!!! most of it is the ball wedging under its face or headbutting
	-- if you can prove its because hes losing the ball when hes really close and that he is headbutting because hes using gps ball
	then something to try is to make him keep his head in the same location
	rather than making him look at gps ball..	ie look at old position
	Maybe we should try this anyway!!!
	-- i tried investigating this.. notice the leds ive got set up ... but it didn't look like he was losing the ball when getting close.
	-- does making him track the ball higher help??? i tried changing his ball tracking thing so that he tracks 2.5 cms above the ball but this wasn't good
	because he lost the ball when he was close... maybe try just 1 cm...
	-- another theory.. you know how he stumbles when he does the slow down near ball... maybe the stumble causes him to headbutt the ball??
	this theory is totally unproven.. its just a thought
	in anycase that stumble should be fixed... dots definately doesnt' stumble when slowing down
