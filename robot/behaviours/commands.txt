u:
Simultaneous ABSOLUTE pan/tilt values of format "x y"
Sent automatically by mouse program, but can also be used manually,
e.g. "4 4" = look left 4, look up 4 simultaneously. 

k:
same as u except the robot moves tilt first then pan

j:
Simultaneous RELATIVE 'f', 'l' and 't' commands (see below) of format "x y z"
Sent automatically by joystick program, but can also be used manually,
e.g. "4 4 0" = move forward 4, strafe left 4, turn 0, all simultaneously.
Use "0 0 0" to stop.

i:
Receives joystick button information in the format "t b". There are 
3 possible values for 't', and 12 possible values for 'b', giving 36
