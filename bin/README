This is the directory stored all the useful scripts related 
to Robocup.

In order to get the excutables running everywhere, you need 
to set two enviroment variables: $PATH and $ROBOCUP_DIR.

$ROBOCUP_DIR is the parent diretory of 'base' and 'robot', 
as well as this directory ('bin'). Absolute path is required, 
without '/' at the end.
	e.g. ROBOCUP_DIR=/home/<username>/trunk


Here're sample lines that I put in .bashrc (or .profile):

export ROBOCUP_DIR=/home/weiming/trunk
export PATH=$ROBOCUP_DIR/bin:$PATH
