This is the rUNSWift port of python 2.3 to OPEN_R

To build:

Grab the python2.3 source.  I used:

http://python.org/ftp/python/2.3.3/Python-2.3.3.tgz

with md5sum:

4d16732b1cfccc0ed250956d41463c61  Python-2.3.3.tgz

Unpack this:

tar zxf python2.3.3.tgz

and move it to be called src:

mv Python-2.3.3 src

Apply the src.diff patch:

patch -p0 < src.diff

Install the OPEN_R_EXTRAS.  This means copying the files from that dir into the same path in your OPEN_R_SDK directory.  Then run buildlib.sh.

The include and lib files are left in the mipsel-python dir.
